# Integrate and leverage open-source interoperable data/metadata servers that support FAIR principles (ERDDAP)

## Strategic relevance

Objectives 1,2,3,5

## Region(s) and/or Communities of relevance

Global

## Importance and Urgency

**Importance:** critical

**Urgency:** very high

**Timeframe for implementation:**  The timeframe for implementation of ERDDAP services would be ongoing and could start immediately by integrating these services in technologically ready environments

## Recommendation(s)

As discussed in the GOOS  Observations Coordination Group (OCG) Cross-Network Implementation Strategy, ERDDAP has been identified as a FAIR-compliant data server which can improve interoperability, accessibility and discoverability of (meta)data for stakeholders. 


## Relation to existing capacities / initiatives

ERDDAP features strongly in the aforementioned GOOS OCG work to improve meta(data) interoperability across the GOOS global in situ networks (Argo, Buoys, ship, etc). 

## Resourcing required

ERDDAP is a relatively low technical burden as, once installed, it is mostly about configuring datasets and eliminates the need to code around multiple formats, access methods etc.  If resources were available for some amount of time to support a data curator, the integration of data into ERDDAP would be smoother. 

## Caveats, concerns, and limitations 

Some groups may lack technical support to provide a data services on the internet.  Hopefully GOOS or UN Decade could assist by providing data services for such groups.
