# Data centers and global ocean data aggregators should lower the barrier for other data providers to contribute to data repositories

## Strategic relevance

Objective #1

relates to -> Each existing or emerging user or provider of ocean data and information -including non-traditional data and information, such as local and Indigenousknowledge or citizen science -should be able to fully participate in and shape the ocean digital ecosystem

## Region(s) and/or Communities of relevance

**Regions:** e.g. Global
**Communities:** e.g. science and those currently curate large ocean data systems

## Importance and Urgency

**Importance:** [very high]

**Urgency:** [very high]

**Timeframe for implementation:** Where relevant, comment on what timeframe this recommendation should be acted upon, with a brief explanation on your rationale.

## Recommendation(s)

"We should work with national data centers, global data repositories and aggregators to lower the barriers to contribute with the data, so that citizen science projects, industries and local communities that gather data could contribute to well known (to science and some governments) repositories.
Data centers should have an option of listing the dataset and metadata (including provenance), QC algorythm (if exist) or flar if there is none. IT should be up to end user to decide whether the data is useful and good enough quality or not.
"

we should run the pilot to demo the value

## Relation to existing capacities / initiatives

What existing activities in the regions noted above can be engaged to implement the recommendation?

Examples of the projects:
https://dugnadforhavet.no/ - citizen science project curated by the Institute Marine Research, yet I am not sure if the data from the project flow to some other bigger aggregator where it can be discovered by potentially interested users from the other side of the globe
https://www.goesfoundation.com/ - the team sails the ocean for 3 years non-stop and collects various data on SML - their data have nowhere to go (according to what they say), yet somebody might be interested in this data regardless of quality

There are hundreds of similar examples, when combined, it could be huge data repo


## Resourcing required

Provide rough indications of what kind of resources are required to implement the recommendation. 
These should include estimates of training costs, personnel and their qualifications, monetary estimates for personnel, equipment, etc, and administrative support.
