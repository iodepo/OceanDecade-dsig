# Funding agencies - National Data Centers - data from the newly funded ocean-related projects

## Strategic relevance

Which Objectives, Enablers, or other element of the [strategy document](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000385542.locale=en) does this statement relate to?


Objective 5
-> Reinforce resource mobilization, with adequate funding towards ocean data  and information management skills

the recommendation also relates to -> significant gaps in ocean data remains ... because the data  ... are currently held in hidden, inaccessible databases.

also relates to -> there are resource and capacity gaps to collect, curate, manage, and share ocean data and information digitally, including a lack of data management trained personnel.

## Region(s) and/or Communities of relevance

**Regions:** Global
**Communities:** science

## Importance and Urgency

**Importance:** [very high]

**Urgency:** [critical] - all related to culture change is critically urgent because it takes a very long time and the sooner we start, the better it is for the ocean

**Timeframe for implementation:** 2024 - The pilot can start next year, so for example, the next calls that are out in 1/5 year or so may well include recommendations mentioned below

## Recommendation(s)

Funding agencies publish calls for proposals saying that the consortium allocates budget for data management and makes data publicly open at the end of the project. This is no longer enough as a requirement.

"We should engage with the country's major funding agency (it can be that those are even Decade partners) to pilot the following:
in future calls for proposals, for ocean-related projects that will capture new data, in addition to thorough description data management, the consortium is obliged to:
1. push the final data from the project into the database that is part of the national data center, they may well create a new database or use their local institution-based database, but they should ensure that it is linked to the national data center
2. dedicate funding not only for project data management but funding that will go to the national data center to maintain and curate the data from the project; alternatively the national data center should be beneficiary of the project"

The funding agency, in the next calls for proposals, should ensure:
1) that they allocate extra funding to all chosen projects, to train data managers unless they include an experienced data manager (should be proven with CV) in the consortium
2) that they allocate extra funding (under the umbrella of the chosen project) that will go to the National Data Center to maintain and curate linkage to the database of the project.

## Relation to existing capacities / initiatives

What existing activities in the regions noted above can be engaged to implement the recommendation?
Noting recommendations I had in mind:
Norwegian Research Council - https://www.forskningsradet.no/om-oss/forskningskommunikasjon/
National Data Marine Center - https://www.nmdc.no/

## Resourcing required

Implement recommendation will require coordination, workshops (discussing with funding agency and national data center their maturity to implement it, their incentives and requirements of doing so), time; 
Strong advocacy of the current data strategy and recommendations for implementation at a high level will be required. 

## Caveats, concerns, and limitations 

Implement recommendations will most likely require more permanent positions at the national data center to maintain a lot more data and to modernize the technology;
