# Funding agencies - National Data Centers - data from the newly funded ocean-related projects

## Strategic relevance

Which Objectives, Enablers, or other element of the [strategy document](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000385542.locale=en) does this statement relate to?
Objecctive 5
-> Reinforce resource mobilisation, with adequate funding towards ocean data  and information management skills

## Region(s) and/or Communities of relevance

**Regions:** e.g. West Africa, Antarctic, Global
**Communities:** e.g. fishers, conservationists, recreational sailors

## Importance and Urgency

**Importance:** [very high]

**Urgency:** [critical] - all related to culture change is critically urgent becuase it taked very long time and the sooner we start, the better it is for the ocean

**Timeframe for implementation:** 2024 - pilot can start already next year, so for example next calls that are out in 1/5 year or so may well include recommendations mentioned below

## Recommendation(s)

"We should engage with country's major funding agency (it can be that those are even Decade partners) to pilot following:
in future calls for proposals, for ocean-related projects that will capture new data, in addition to thorough description data management, consortium is obliged to:
1. push the final data from the project in the data base that is part of national data center, they may well create a new data base or use their local institution-based database, but they should ensure that it is linked to the national data center
2. dedicate funding not only for project data management but funding that will go to the national data center to maintain and curate the data from the project; alternatively the national data center should be beneficiary of the project"

The funding agency, in the next calls for proposals, should ensure:
1) that they allocate extra funding to all chosen projects, to train data manager unless they include experrienced data manager (should be proven with CV) in the consortium
2) that they allocate extra funding (under the umbrella of chosen project) that will go to the National Data Center to maintain and curate linkage to the data base of the project.

## Relation to existing capacities / initiatives

What existing activities in the regions noted above can be engaged to implement the recommendation?
Noting recommedations I had in ming:
Norwegian Research Council - https://www.forskningsradet.no/om-oss/forskningskommunikasjon/
National Data Marine Center - https://www.nmdc.no/

## Resourcing required

To implement recommendation will require coordination, workshops (discussing with funding agency and national data center their maturity to implement it, their incentives and requirements of doing so), time; 
Strong advocacy of current data strategy and recommentation for implementation at the high level will be required. 

## Caveats, concerns, and limitations 

To implement recommendation will most likely require more permanent positions at the national data center to maintain a lot more data and to modernize the technology;
