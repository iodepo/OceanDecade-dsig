# Apply widely 'design thinking approach' when creating new digital solution

## Strategic relevance

Objective #4: Prioritise digital solutions that support decisions for sustainable ocean management

-> existing valuable ocean data, information, and knowledge are often not available to those that need them in a form that they can understand and act upon



## Region(s) and/or Communities of relevance

**Regions:** Global
**Communities:** whoever needs the solution and whoever creates one, e.g., decisions makers and scientists; industry, scientists and governments; local communities/citizens - scientists; start-ups - end users;


## Importance and Urgency

**Importance:** Co-creation of solutions is critiacally important and urgent, design thinking is one of many possible approaches
**Urgency:** critical

**Timeframe for implementation:** Co-creation as a recommendation should be acted upon rather soon, yet it will take time and culture change and the right incentives for people from multiple segments to join the co-creation process

## Recommendation(s)

"We should advocate for the entire data value chain and design thinking approach when creating new solution (data product, interface, dashboard, portal, metadata  standards,  software,  models,  analytics, artificial  intelligence  solutions,  user  experiences). "

identify those who need solutions, get in touch, co-create through design thinking approach, which has 5 steps:

"The five stages of design thinking, are:

Empathize: research your users’ needs.
Define: state your users’ needs and problems.
Ideate: challenge assumptions and create ideas.
Prototype: start to create solutions.
Test: try your solutions out"

This requires cross-segment open-minded partnerships, where everybody speaks "easy to understand" language (industry - government - science - citizens - start ups partnerships and co-funded (through tenders?) projects to deliver the solution).
External review of the solution underway to double check on methodology and usefulness (integrated within feedback loop)

## Relation to existing capacities / initiatives

What existing activities in the regions noted above can be engaged to implement the recommendation?

Here I can provide two examples:
(1) AT HUB Ocean, to develop Ocean Data Platform, we actively apply design thinking approach to understand end-users, current pains, and future gains end-users might have with new developments; we have conducted dozens of interviews to underatand the needs in different segments. Feddback loops are established with individuals from different segments to make sure ODP is a useful digital solution when it is ready.
(2) A while ago I was a part of global sprint organized for Open Ocean Cloud (https://openocean.cloud/) by @rabernat (not sure how to tag people in here but name is Ryan Abernathey https://github.com/rabernat); so this global sprint gathered many oceanographers from across the globe to collect experiences and bottlenecks of the current ocean data work. The finalized document was supposed to contribute to the Open Ocean Cloud infrastructure (not sure what is the status), but it was organized in some kind of gaming environment, which was interactive and motivating process. It lasted for 3 days. 

## Resourcing required
...need community to brainstorm here
Provide rough indications of what kind of resources are required to implement the recommendation. 
These should include estimates of training costs, personnel and their qualifications, monetary estimates for personnel, equipment, etc, and administrative support. 

## Caveats, concerns, and limitations 

List any obstacles or concerns about the recommendations?

Different segments:
work at different pace
have different motivation and values
speak different languages

therefore we need advocacy for open-minded involvement and actions
