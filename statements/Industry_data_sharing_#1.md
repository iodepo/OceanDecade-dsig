## Importance and Urgency

**Importance:** [high]

**Urgency:** [very high]

**Timeframe for implementation:** The sooner we promote values for sharing the data and experiences to overcome obstacles, the better
## Recommendation(s)

"When discussing with private companies ocean data sharing, we should promote the following values (for them) (based on analysis of past exercises, new coming regulations ([CSRD](https://finance.ec.europa.eu/capital-markets-union-and-financial-markets/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/corporate-sustainability-reporting_en), [TNFD](https://tnfd.global/) etc.), rising risks due to climate change and financial incentives):

**Thought Leadership**:
Build positive brand capital by driving the ocean-sharing agenda in new arenas, positioning your company as the leading environmental data liberator
Share to define the new normal of data sharing and catalyze it, to make sure your company is ahead of the wave.

**Transition to Blue**:
Partner with stakeholders to transform the value and access to your companyâ€™s ocean environmental and biodiversity data at a global scale to fight for our oceans.
Join forces to measure and understand your company's nature impact to create a nature-positive pathway, while partnering to enable seamless ocean climate reporting to governments and financial institutions.

**Sustainable operations**:
Available technologies can operate and maintain both your own and relevant third-party ocean environmental data while infusing your data with new geospatial insights.
Join the work with science to transform your company's ocean environmental data into improved climate models to better assess and manage climate-related risk.

**Expand Business**:
Identify and access relevant users of the surplus environmental data.
Initiate or continue the work with science and industry players to identify the mutual benefits of data sharing.
Make the FAIR surplus data easily accessible at a global scale via available interfaces at your conditions."
