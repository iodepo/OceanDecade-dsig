3) Build trust in data and information

## Region(s) and/or Communities of relevance

**Regions:** Global
**Communities:** all

## Importance and Urgency

**Importance:** high

**Urgency:** [critical, very high, high, neither high nor low, low, very low]

**Timeframe for implementation:** Where relevant, comment on what timeframe this recommendation should be acted upon, with a brief explanation on your rationale.

## Recommendation(s)

1. Appropriate types of quality indicators should be collated (both quantitative and qualitative).
2. Data providers should ensure their data includes at least some of these quality indicators

## Relation to existing capacities / initiatives

What existing activities in the regions noted above can be engaged to implement the recommendation?

## Resourcing required

Provide rough indications of what kind of resources are required to implement the recommendation. 
These should include estimates of training costs, personnel and their qualifications, monetary estimates for personnel, equipment, etc, and administrative support. 

## Caveats, concerns, and limitations 

Quality is not an absolute value, but is related to the task that people want to use the data for. I.e. data that is of high enough qualty for one purpose might not be suitable for a different purpose.
Quality indicators can be very domain specific.
