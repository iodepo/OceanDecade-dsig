# Identify Global Data Repositories providing access to (meta)data and products

## Strategic relevance

Objectives 1,2,3,5

## Region(s) and/or Communities of relevance

Global

## Importance and Urgency

**Importance:** critical
**Urgency:** critical

**Timeframe for implementation:** Immediately.  In order to populate the digital ocean ecosystem, it is critical to understand the official sources of ocean data.

## Recommendation(s)

We should develop a list of the official global data repositories for ocean data.  In the GOOS in situ data community, this would mostly likey be the Global Data Assembly Centers (GDACS).

## Relation to existing capacities / initiatives

The GOOS Observations Coordination Group is involved in identifying and enhancing the GDACs for the GOOS global in situ networks 

## Resourcing required

Unknown.

## Caveats, concerns, and limitations 

One issue is that critical ocean datasets may not be available through offical global data repositories.
