Objectives: 2,3,4
Enablers: 

## Region(s) and/or Communities of relevance

**Regions:** All
**Communities:** across all observational data 

## Importance and Urgency

**Importance:** very high

**Urgency:** high

**Timeframe for implementation:** Where relevant, comment on what timeframe this recommendation should be acted upon, with a brief explanation on your rationale.

## Recommendation(s)

- Encourage the use of PID's across data lineage.


## Relation to existing capacities / initiatives



## Resourcing required

A largescale review of current capabilities and future growth in the area is needed to make a clear recommendation which would include:
- Document the current state of Persistent Identifiers and use across all stages of the data pipeling and specific versions that have been created for different data types ( ex. [IFDO's](https://marine-imaging.com/fair/ifdos/iFDO-overview/))
- Evaluate how PID's can be used for tracking sensor metadata all the way throgh data lineage
- Reveiw and elicte how sensor manufactures could use PID's

## Caveats, concerns, and limitations
