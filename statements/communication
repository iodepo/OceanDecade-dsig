## Strategic relevance

Objective 3

## Region(s) and/or Communities of relevance

**Regions:** Global
**Communities:** e.g. broad stakeholders

## Importance and Urgency

**Importance:** [critical]

**Urgency:** [high]

**Timeframe for implementation:** Short to mid-term

## Recommendation(s)

Ensure that data products and information are well understood by the broad community of end-users. Build trust in the data and processes associated, and expand usage beyond academic institutions toward decision-making and society awareness.   

## Relation to existing capacities / initiatives



## Resourcing required

Ensure resources and specialized guidance for outreach and communication during the development and release of data products and information interfaces, to be continued in the long-term. 

## Caveats, concerns, and limitations 

Several data products and information interfaces are far beyond being used by the global community to make informed decisions and solve current problems toward a sustainable ocean. The already limited resources allocated to data and information development might be wasted if usage and awareness are not expanded.
