# Exchange data in near-real time through WMO mechanisms where possible

## Strategic relevance

Objective 1,2,3,5

## Region(s) and/or Communities of relevance

Global

## Importance and Urgency

**Importance:** very high

**Urgency:** high

**Timeframe for implementation:** The more ocean data we can bet flowing through the operational systems, the more accurate forecasts for weather, safety of life at sea, etc, will be.  As well, the sooner this can happen, the better.

## Recommendation(s)

Relevant data that is collected in near-real time should exchanged through the WMO Global Telecommunications System (GTS) or WMO Information System (WIS) 2.0.   For Un Decade projects that do not have a direct connection to a National Weather Service, it may be possible to work the the UN Decade Activity #143.2 â€œThe Open Access to GTS (Open-GTS) Project to exchange data through WMO services.

## Relation to existing capacities / initiatives

As noted above, working with National Weather Services, or the Open-GTS should be engaged as relevant.

## Resourcing required

Some resources would be needed to support the exchange of data through the Open-GTS.  Resourcing for exchange of data through local weather services would be specific to that service.

## Caveats, concerns, and limitations 

The biggest obstacle is likely financial support to carry out the exchange of data.
